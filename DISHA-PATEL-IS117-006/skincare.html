                        <li>Dry Skin: Is a common skin condition that results from insufficient moisture, which can lead to a loss of suppleness and elasticity. Causes include genetics, environmental factors such as low humidity and cold weather, as well as lifestyle choices such as frequent hot showers and the use of harsh soaps. The symptoms of dry skin include tightness, flakiness, roughness, and itching. Regular use of moisturizing skincare products, drinking plenty of water, and avoiding hot water and harsh soaps can help dry skin.</li> 
                        <li>Oily Skin: Is a common skin issue that occurs when the skin produces sebum, which is an oily substance that helps to moisturize and protect the skin. Caused by various factors, including genetics, hormonal changes, diet, and environmental factors. The symptoms of oily skin include a shiny or greasy appearance, enlarged pores, acne, and blackheads. Oily skin has some benefits, such as a reduced appearance of wrinkles. Using a gentle cleanser, oil-free moisturizers, and an exfoliating product can help manage oily skin.</li>
                        <li>Combination Skin: Is a skin type that has both oily and dry areas. Caused by various factors, such as genetics, hormonal changes, and environmental factors. The symptoms of combination skin include oily T-zone, enlarged pores, acne, dry patches, and flakiness. Using a gentle cleanser, using oil-free moisturizer, hydrating products and spot treating the oily areas can help manage combination skin.</li>
                        <li>Dehydrated Skin: Is a condition that occurs when the skin lacks hydration even though the skin might be oily. Can be caused by various factors, such as harsh skincare products, hot showers, low humidity, and inadequate water intake. The symptoms include a dull and tired appearance, fine lines and wrinkles, tightness, and flakiness. Dehydrated skin is a temporary condition, unlike the other skin types. To treat this condition use hydrating ingredients, like hyaluronic acid and snail mucin, drink water, use a humidifier, a supple moisturizer, and a gentle cleanser.</li>
                        <li>Sensitive Skin: Is a condition that causes the skin to react more easily to irritants than other skin types. Symptoms include redness, itching, burning, dryness, hives, and flaking. It can be triggered by allergens, over-exfoliating, pollution, and weather. People with sensitive skin may have cystic acne and irritation. This can be managed by using fragrance-free products, a gentle cleanser, and hydrating products.</li>
                        <li>Acne-Prone Skin: Is a skin condition where the person experiences consistent and cystic acne. Can be caused by the overproduction of oil or sebum, which clogs pores causing pimples, blackheads, and whiteheads. Hormonal imbalances, stress, certain medications, and genetics play a huge role. Some symptoms are inflammation, redness, and scarring. Using tretinoin, managing stress, cleansing the skin, keeping a clean environment, and hydrating the skin can help manage acne. It is best to visit a dermatologist.</li>
                        <li>Normal Skin: Is a skin type that is well-balanced. There is not an over production of sebum or excess dryness. The skin is healthy and radiant, blemish free, and has normal sized pores. Though people with this skin type have good skin it is important to have a gentle and consistent skin routine.</li>
